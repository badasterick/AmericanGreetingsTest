Dear American Greetings,

Thank you for taking the time to review my test submission. 

The project is located on github: https://github.com/badasterick/AmericanGreetingsTest.git
Just in case, I have also uploaded the project to google drive here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UgMHIHVyKxsc3ljidWf8jBDlMKFdoKag/view?usp=sharing

------------------------
Builds and Executables:
------------------------
Please see AmericanGreetingsTest -> Builds to locate the final versions of the project.
I have 2 .apks that will run the test and an extra game I made on any Android device. They are titled: AmericanGreetingsTest.apk and ShapeGame.apk
I also have 2 PC executables in the American Greetings Test PC Build and Shape Game PC Build folders.

Unfortunately I do not own any Apple products (minus an iPod video from 2006) so I was unable to include any iOS builds. I have made proper builds in the past with the proper environment. I apologize for the inconvenience.

Project Notes:
------------------------
The AmericanGreetingsTest.unity scene contains my work for the core test:

1. A hexagon that changes to a random color when double clicked. Any double clicks outside of the shape will do nothing.
2. A dropdown UI that allows the user to switch between a Hexagon, Circle, and Triangle shape. I made it so every shape keeps its own color. If you change the color of one shape it will NOT change the color of other shapes.
3. The scene supports both Portrait and Landscape resolutions tested on an Android Galaxy S9. It will suport Landscape resolutions on Windows (PC). 
4. The scene will also run with the Unity Remote 5 app if you would like to test it through the Unity editor.

The HexGame.unity scene contains my work for the Optional Challenges:
1. A timed based game where players tap on a shape to score points. The goal is to score the highest amount of points within 60 seconds. Each shape tapped upon gives the player 10 points.
2. Standard animations for the shapes (hexagon, cirlce, triangle). They will rotate and scale up to be tapped. 
3. Masking on the shapes. I included 3 masks over the shapes (desert, mountain, beach). Unfortunately I did not design the game to bring out the full effect of masking so you cannot expose different parts of the hidden image but the mask is properly set up.
4. An explosion sound effect will occur when a Shape is tapped.
5. Particle effects are attached to the shapes and will appear when they spawn.
6. I implemented a high score system. If you get the high score, there will be a message to acknowledge your achievement. The high score will be saved in the app for different playthroughs. If you want to reset the high score, you can press the 'R' key on your keyboard (Unfortunately for Android you will have to uninstall and reinstall the app).


Thank you again for your time. If you have any questions about the submission, please feel free to reach out to me by email: zalaranthony@gmail.com or phone: (440)725-2372.


Cheers!
